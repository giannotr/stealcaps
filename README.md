# The `stealcaps` package

This package enables you to borrow small capitals
from another font than the main document font.
For that simply load the package and specify the replacement font
vie the key-value-option 'from', i.e.

    \usepackage[from=<font name>]{stealcaps}.

In case you use pdfLaTeX the font name has to be NFSS compliant.
With XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, correpsondingly,
it has to be `fontspec` compliant.

Furthermore in Xe(La)TeX or Lua(La)TeX you can use `\renewcaps`
to load a dedicated only small capitals font like

		\renewcaps{Cormorant SC}.

Package dependencies: `pgfopts`, `iftex`, `fontspec`.

This is version 1.1 of the package.
